# Scroll
A social network based on proximity and amount of mutual friends.

## Abstract
Scroll is a React Native front-end / Ruby on Rails back-end application for friends to share their photos with each other. The main motivation behind it is to focus social interaction between close friends first, but be able to exit their network and explore with ease.

## Technologies
Front-End
- React Native
Back-End
- Ruby on Rails

## User Stories
A user will be able to:
- register an account / login to an existing account
- navigate through their friends' posts in zoom view and post view;
- post and update photos with captions and comments;
- change post rendering between chronological, close friends, and proximity;
- liking posts;
- add a friend through their username;
- go to a friend's profile and see their posts;
- block a user (because all social networks need this);

## MVP
